<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>elieve it or not, I am half Honduran and speak fluent Spanish. Although my father is Scottish and Swedish, my mother is from Honduras. My father met my mother in Tegucigalpa while he was in the Peace Corps and she was an executive secretary for the Honduran Department of Health. They fell in love, moved back to the US, and I was born in New Jersey.</p>
<p>So I grew up with Central American food such as refried red beans, hand-made corn tortillas (totally unlike store bought), Baleadas, Pupusas, and other dishes you likely have not heard of.</p>
<p>My father was an officer in the Navy so I grew up traveling every 1&ndash;2 years to port cities such as Newport, Rhode Island;  Jacksonville, Florida;  Monterey, California;  and Veracruz, Mexico. In fact, I went to Junior High in Puerto Rico and High School in Rota, Spain.</p>
<p>I decided to attend the University of Florida because I was offered a full ride and it has the strongest engineering program in the state. As a highlight, mostly to have fun, I got involved with the <a href=" http://mil.ufl.edu/">Intelligent Machine Learning Lab</a> where I built a couple robots &mdash; one of which was a miniature self driving car.</p>
<p>I thought for a long time I was going to work for Boeing in St. Louis until I did IBM's <a href=" http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/">Extreme Blue</a> program in Austin, Texas. I fell in love with Austin back before there was so much traffic. The bodies of water, vibrant young professionals, friends from Extreme Blue, and frankly no state income tax attracted me. I lived in Austin for 10 years, where I bought a home, and worked for IBM traveling internationally doing consulting, writing, and speaking at conferences. A lot of my work was in the software appliance space or products that are a hybrid between software and hardware. Some of my favorite "gigs" or consulting projects were in Edinburgh,  Sydney, and Istanbul.</p>
<p>At the tail end of my time in Austin, I worked for the Texas Health Department as an IT manager. My primary motivation was to be of public service and not to travel so much anymore.</p>
<p>In 2014, I met my Fianc&eacute;e on a mountain top where there was a resident population of 8! During a road trip from Sedona, I visited a remote retreat center at the base of the rockies in northern New Mexico near the border to Colorado. We met during a community dinner. Some months later, I moved to New Mexico and we lived together at the Lama Foundation volunteering our services for a year.</p>
<p>We are now expecting our first child and happily live in western Massachusetts. </p>
